Implemented Currency Converter using Spring Boot as Backend and Thymeleaf in the frontend

Used Spring Data JPA as ORM for interacting with MySql Database

USD($) is currently used as the base currency type

Currently static currency values are stored for Each currency in Database (Which is not recommended) for demo purpose. This can be replaced by fetching
currency values in real time by using third party APIs like https://www.iban.com/. This makes the backend more dynamic. This can be considered as a future improvement.
