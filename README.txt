Implemented Currency Converter using Spring Boot as Backend and Thymeleaf in the frontend by following MVCS design pattern.

Frontend code can be found in src/main/resources.

Used Spring Data JPA as ORM for interacting with MySql Database.

USD($) is currently used as the base currency type.

Currently static currency values are stored for Each currency in Database (Which is not recommended) for demo purpose. This can be replaced by fetching currency values in real time by using third party APIs like https://www.iban.com/. This makes the backend more dynamic. This can be considered as a future improvement.

Boiler plate code can be reduced by using Lombok
